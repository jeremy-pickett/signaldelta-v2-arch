SignalDelta Collector ↔ Signal Gap Reconciliation
February 8, 2026
________________


The Core Finding
140+ collectors exist. 80 signals cataloged. Only ~12 signals are active in the scorer.
The bottleneck is not data collection. It's the integration pipeline: collector → signal table → scorer → API. Collectors are 3–5x ahead of signal integration.
________________


Signals with Existing Collectors Incorrectly Marked "Not Built"
These signals were cataloged as unbuilt but have collectors already written. The actual gap is scorer integration, not data collection. Engineering effort drops from "weeks" to "days."

The two gaps are both integration gaps, not capability gaps. The data exists. The signals are designed. The wiring between layers is incomplete.

Impact on API v2
The collector layer is not part of the API server. Collectors run as scheduled background tasks (currently via run_all.py cron, v2 via ARQ scheduled tasks). The API serves the output of collectors via the signal and scorer layers.
However, the API v2 architecture needs to account for:
1. Collector health monitoring — the /status endpoint should report collector last-run times and error rates
2. Manual collector triggers — admin endpoints to force-run specific collectors
3. Collector output as API data — raw collector data (whale transactions, insider trades) is valuable API content beyond just the scored signals
